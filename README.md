# chorganizer

- This program will randomly assign chores to a list of people depending on how urgently the chore needs to be completed
- Current functionality:
  -Takes a csv file with the format "Chore name, frequency (days), date last completed in mm-dd-yyyy"
  -Makes a priority queue based on how long it's been since the chore has been completed
  -Assigns breaks to Mikayla, Spencer, and Owen in random order according to priority queue
  
-Goals:
  -Read people from file rather than hard coded list
  -Implement a "Mark complete" function
